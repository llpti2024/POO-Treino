# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Exercises

This repository contains exercises and projects focused on **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts, designed to reinforce and deepen understanding of OOP principles through practical applications.

## üõ†Ô∏è Topics Covered

### Core OOP Concepts:
- **Classes and Objects**: Defining and creating reusable blueprints for objects.
- **Attributes and Methods**: Managing object data and behaviors.
- **Access Modifiers**: **private**, **public**, **protected**, and **default**.
- **Encapsulation**: Protecting data with getters and setters.
- **Constructors**: Initializing object states.
- **Static Members**: Shared properties and methods across objects.

### Advanced OOP Principles:
- **Inheritance**: Reusing and extending existing classes.
- **Polymorphism**: Overriding and overloading methods for flexibility.
- **Abstract Classes and Interfaces**: Defining contracts and base functionality.
- **Composition and Aggregation**: Building complex objects through relationships.
- **toString Method**: Customizing object representations.

### Additional Topics:
- **Exception Handling**: Creating robust programs with error management.
- **Collections and Generics**: Using **ArrayList**, **HashMap**, and custom generics.
- **Design Patterns**: Implementing OOP best practices (e.g., Singleton, Factory).

## üìÅ Repository Structure

- **`/exercises`**: Practical OOP exercises organized by topic.
- **`/projects`**: Small projects demonstrating the integration of multiple OOP concepts.
- **`/notes`**: Key notes and explanations for quick reference.

## üèÜ Goals

- Master the principles of OOP to design robust, reusable, and maintainable software.
- Apply theoretical concepts through hands-on coding exercises.
- Develop problem-solving skills by implementing OOP techniques in various scenarios.

## üìö Learning Objectives

1. Understand and apply the four pillars of OOP: **Encapsulation**, **Inheritance**, **Polymorphism**, and **Abstraction**.
2. Build modular and scalable applications using object-oriented design.
3. Solve real-world programming problems with OOP methodologies.
